# Udemy_100_Days_Of_Code
Udemys 100 Days of Code: Python edition. 

Multiple projects that I have done following this course. Categorised by difficulty. Some files are missing the css.
I took it away because I haven't done most of it.

Usually the project base is downloaded during the start of the course day. Otherwise all functionality is done by yours truly.
